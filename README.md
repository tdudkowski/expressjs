# Express.js App

This is my first try on MongoDB and Express.js framework. It is based on Udemy course by Samuraj et al [Node.js, Express i MongoDB](https://www.udemy.com/course/kurs-nodejs-express-mongodb/).

All information are on the Heroku site where it was deployed [Express App](https://express-td.herokuapp.com/).
